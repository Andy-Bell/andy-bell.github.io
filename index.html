          A multi-threaded web server built in Rust. 
        <br>
          Currently still a very early prototype, only has basic routing, and no error handling.

        <p>
          Since August 2016 I have been working for the web development agency Simpleweb.
        <br>
          Unfortunately pretty much all of my work has been for clients and is not publicly available.
        <br>
          During this time I have worked predominantly on the back-end of many of our sites,
        <br>
          across a range of languages - Ruby, PHP and Node being the main ones.

        <p>A "battle" app, made in Ruby Sinatra in which two players can participate,
        <br>
        decorated in the most horrific GeoCities-esque CSS we could manage.</p>

        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am primarily a back-end Developer, languages used in production include Ruby on Rails,
        <br>
        PHP, Node, C#, with a small amount of mobile app development in Obj-C and React Native.
        <br>
        In my spare time I have been experimenting with several other languages, 
        <br>
        My current favourites are Rust, Haskell and Erlang.
        <br>
        I would love to be able to use these in production.
