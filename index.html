          A multi-threaded web server built in Rust. 
          Currently still a very early prototype, 
          only has basic routing, and no error handling.

          A basic search engine (Pythia) and web crawler (Delphi) using Elixir and the Phoenix framework for the web-app.
          This was my final project for the Makers Academy Bootcamp.

          <p>
          Since August 2016 I have been working for the web development agency Simpleweb.
          Unfortunately pretty much all of my work has been for clients and is not publicly available.
          During this time I have worked predominantly on the back-end of many of our sites,
          across a range of languages - Ruby, PHP and Node being the main ones.

          A "battle" app, made in Ruby Sinatra in which two players can participate,
          decorated in the most horrific GeoCities-esque CSS we could manage.

          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
        I am primarily a back-end Developer, languages used in production include Ruby on Rails, PHP, Node, C#, with a small amount of mobile app development in Obj-C and React Native.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time I have been experimenting with several other languages. 
        My current favourites are Rust, Haskell and Elixir.
        I would love to be able to use these in production.
